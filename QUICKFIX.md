# Quick Fix for NumPy Compatibility Issue

## Problem
The application was crashing on startup with the error:
```
AttributeError: _ARRAY_API not found
ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import
```

This was caused by a matplotlib compiled with NumPy 1.x trying to run with NumPy 2.x.

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. Requirements Fix
- Added `numpy<2.0.0` to requirements.txt to force compatible version
- This ensures matplotlib can work properly

### 2. Graceful Matplotlib Handling
- Added try/catch around matplotlib imports in app.py
- Created fallback when matplotlib is unavailable
- App now continues to work even if chart generation fails

### 3. Docker Rebuild Required
If you're using Docker, you'll need to rebuild:

```bash
# Stop current containers
docker-compose down

# Rebuild with new requirements
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Start fresh
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Local Installation Fix
For local development:

```bash
# Uninstall incompatible versions
pip uninstall numpy matplotlib -y

# Install fixed versions
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## What's Fixed ✅
- ✅ Application starts without crashing
- ✅ Chart generation works when matplotlib available
- ✅ App continues working even if matplotlib fails
- ✅ Docker deployment now stable
- ✅ No loss of core functionality

## Testing
After applying the fix:
1. Application should start successfully
2. Core features (upload, adaptation, translation) work normally
3. Charts may show placeholder if matplotlib unavailable, but won't crash app

This fix maintains full functionality while preventing the startup crash.
