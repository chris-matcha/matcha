# Adaptation Service Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated adaptation functionality from app.py to the AdaptationsService, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. AdaptationsService Enhancements
- Moved `AdaptationCache` class from app.py to adaptations_service.py
- Added batch processing methods:
  - `process_text_batch()` - Process multiple texts efficiently
  - `_process_single_batch()` - Handle single batch with AI
  - `_get_batch_instructions()` - Profile-specific batch instructions
- Cache now integrated into the service with LRU eviction

### 2. Removed from app.py
- `AdaptationCache` class (lines 160-236)
- `create_efficient_prompt()` function
- `process_text_batch()` function (250+ lines)
- `process_single_batch()` function (100+ lines)
- `get_current_file_id()` helper function
- `needs_adaptation()` function (unused)
- `calculate_adaptation_score()` function (unused)
- `generate_recommendation()` function (unused)
- Global variables: `api_call_counter`, `results`, `current_batch`, `current_batch_tokens`
- Removed unused `time` import

### 3. Integration Points
- `adapt_text_with_matcha()` now uses `adaptations_service.adapt_text()`
- Service handles both AI and rule-based adaptations
- Caching is automatic and transparent

## Benefits
1. **Code Reduction**: Removed ~500 lines from app.py
2. **Better Organization**: All adaptation logic in one service
3. **Reusability**: Batch processing can be used by other services
4. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for adaptation logic
5. **Performance**: Integrated caching with LRU eviction

## Usage
```python
# Simple text adaptation
adapted_text = adaptations_service.adapt_text(text, profile_id)

# Batch processing
adapted_texts = adaptations_service.process_text_batch(texts, profile_id)

# Get cache statistics
stats = adaptations_service.get_cache_stats()
```

## Notes
- The service gracefully falls back to rule-based adaptation if no AI API key is available
- Batch processing automatically chunks texts for optimal API usage
- Cache size is configurable (default: 2000 entries)
