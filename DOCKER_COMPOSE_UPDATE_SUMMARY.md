# Docker Compose Update Summary

## Changes Made

### Added Services Directory Mount
**File:** `docker-compose.yml`  
**Change:** Added volume mount for services directory

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./services:/app/services:ro
```

## Why This Update Was Needed

The progress bar fixes involved updating service files in the `/services` directory:
- `pptx_service.py` - Updated to use `progress_callback` instead of `processing_tasks`
- `translations_service.py` - Enhanced with progress callback support
- Other service files remain unchanged

## What This Ensures

1. **Development Consistency**: Services directory changes are reflected in the Docker container
2. **Read-Only Mount**: Services are mounted as read-only (`:ro`) for security
3. **Hot Reloading**: Changes to service files will be available in the container without rebuild

## No Other Changes Needed

✅ **Redis Configuration**: Already present and working for session persistence  
✅ **Environment Variables**: Already configured via `.env` file  
✅ **Dockerfile**: Already copies all application code including services  
✅ **Network Configuration**: Already set up properly  

## Deployment Instructions

For production deployment:

1. **Option 1 - Use Volume Mount (Development/Testing)**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   Services directory changes are reflected immediately.

2. **Option 2 - Rebuild Image (Production)**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build --no-cache web
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   Services are baked into the image (recommended for production).

## Summary

The docker-compose.yml update ensures that progress bar fixes in the services directory are properly available in the Docker environment. No other infrastructure changes are required.
